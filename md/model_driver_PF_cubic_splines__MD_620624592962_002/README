This directory (model_driver_PF_cubic_splines) contains an EAM-like
Model driver written in Fortran 90.
See Reference: Dudarev and Derlet., J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 17 (2005) 7097
or. Mendelev et al. Phil. Mag. 83 (2003) 3977
For details of functional forms

To create a KIM Model from this Model Driver, a parameter file is required.
This file must have the following format:
   Line 1: chemical symbol of the relevant species, e.g. Fe
   Line 2: cutoff value in angstroms
   Line 3: atomic number for biersack-ziegler short-range coloumb screening function
   Line 4: cutoff for coloumb function, cutoff for interpolating function (between coloumb and outer main potential),
           logical flag to define whether interpolating function is a linear polynomial (true) or not (false)
           number of interpolating coefficients,
           rho**2 pre-factor for certain potentials (e.g. Fe, Mendelev) - can be zero
   Line 5: number of density knot points, number of pair-potential knot points
   Line 6: integer dummy, sqrt(rho) prefactor of embedding function ("A"), dummy logical
   Line 7: integer dummy, embedding function magnetic term prefactor -
           zero for non-magnetic potentials ("B"), dummy logical
   Line 8 onwards: lines per density knot function and then lines per pair-part knot function
                   integer dummy, knot coefficient, dummy logical, knot point
   Next lines: line per interpolating coefficient - coefficient on each line
   Last line : text descriptor for potential.
