This directory (Pair_Lennard_Jones_Shifted) contains a shifted Lennard-Jones
pair potential model driver written in Fortran 90.

   phi(r) = 4 * epsilon * ( (sigma/r)^12 - (sigma/r)^6 ) + shift

where 'shift' is computed so that phi(rcut) = 0.0, and 'rcut' is the
cutoff radius.

It complies with the KIM API interface standard, allows alteration of its
parameters,  and supports optional computation of `energy', `forces',
`particleEnergy', `process_dEdr', and `process_dE2dr2'.  Its initialization
routine takes a KIM API object pointer, a pointer to a two-dimensional
character array (each row of which contains the full path to a parameter file)
of the form a[b][c], a pointer to the value of c, and a pointer to the value of
b.  This Model Driver expects that only b=1 and that the associated parameter
file contains the cutoff and Lennard-Jones parameters which define a KIM Model
based on this KIM Model Driver.

To create a KIM Model from this Model Driver, a parameter file is required.
This file must have the following format:

   Line 1: chemical symbol of the atomic species, e.g. Ar
   Line 2: `cutoff' value in angstroms
   Line 3: Lennard-Jones `epsilon' value in eV
   Line 4: Lennard-Jones `sigma' value in Angstroms
