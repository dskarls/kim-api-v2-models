This directory (Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber_MX2__MD_242389978788_001) contains
three-body Stillinger-Weber potential Model Driver for transition metal
dichalcogenide monolayers of the type MX2 (e.g. MoS2 and WSe2).


1. The functional form has been rewritten from the standard SW functional form
   so as to separate the parameters to avoid inconvenience of using this Model
   Driver. The variable 'epsilon' in the standard SW potential is a dummy variable,
   so it is combined with 'A' and 'lambda'. The 'cutoff' of the standard SW potential
   is determined implicitly by 'cutoff' = 'a*sigma', where 'a' and 'sigma' are
   potential parameters. In this Model Driver, the 'cutoff' is defined explicitly.
   The benefit is that if 'sigma' is updated there is no needed to update 'cutoff'.
   Above all, compared to the standard SW potential, the following redefinitions
   have been made:

   A      := A*epsilon
   lambda := lambda*epsilon
   gamma  := gamma*sigma
   cutoff := a*sigma

   Besides, the three-body parameter 'lambda' follows the below mixing rule:
   lambda_ijk = sqrt(lambda_ij*lambda_ik)

   Finally, it is assumed that the angle 'thetea0' is the same for all three-body
   interactions.

   Consequently, the SW Driver for multiple species can be written as:

   E = sum_{i,j>i} phi_2(rij) + sum_{i, j!=i, k>j} phi_3(rij, rik, theta)

   phi_2(rij) = Aij*(Bij(rij/sigma_ij)^(-p) - (rij/sigma_ij)^(-q))
                * exp(sigma_ij/(rij - cutoff_ij))

   phi_3(rij,rik,theta) = sqrt(lambda_ij*lambda_ik)(cos[theta] - cos[theta0])^2
                          * exp(gamma_ij/(rij - cutoff_ij) + gamma_ik/(rik - cutoff_ik))


2. Three-body bond angle bending is considered only for certain interations. Bond
   angle ijk (i is the vertex atom at which bond ij and bond ik form the angle)
   is considered only when atoms j and k are of the same species, but different from
   the species of atom i.  Explicitly, only bond angle of types spec1-spec2-spec2
   and spec2-spec1-spec1 contribute energy to the system. Besides the usual cutoffs
   cutoff_ij and cutoff_ik employed in the standard SW potential, additional cutoff
   cutoff_jk is applied to bond jk. So, once either of the bond length rij, rik, or
   rjk is larger than its corresponding cutoff, the 3-body term vanishes (equals 0).


3. One parameter file is needed, and it should be in the following format:

   First line: number of species (should be 2)

   Lines 2~4: parameters for 2-body interaction
     species1 species2 A B p q sigma gamma cutoff

   Lines 5~6: parameters for 3-body interaction
     species1 species2 species3 lambda cos_beta0 cutoff_jk

   species is valid KIM API particle species string
   A and lambda in [eV]
   sigma, gamma, cutoff, and cutoff_jk in [Angstrom]
   others are unitless
